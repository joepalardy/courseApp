Programs can be of two general types: (1) trips or residential programs sponsored by consortial universities, and (2) independent academic coursework through institutions with which YSU does not have a consortial agreement. A written statement detailing the student 's academic plan must be approved by a member of the Hebrew faculty, the chair of Foreign Languages and the dean of CLASS prior to the trip. May be repeated up to a total of 15 s.h., if specific course content changes. Note: study abroad generally requires about one year 's advance planning.",
